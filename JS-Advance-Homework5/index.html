            Exercise 2:<br>
            <br>
            Make the functions StartAcademy and StartSubject dynamic.<br>
            <br>
            StartAcademy - When the student calls StartAcademy, the student should also be added to the Academy property Students ( The academy that he is starting )<br>
            StartSubject - When the student calls StartSubject the student should also be added to the Subject property Students ( The subject that he is starting ). If there was another subject in the CurrentSubject property, that subject should be transferred to CompletedSubjects and then add the new Subject
